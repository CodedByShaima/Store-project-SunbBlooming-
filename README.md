# SunBlooming Flower Shop Project ‚òÄÔ∏èüåº

## Academic Project
This project was created as part of a course assignment to demonstrate the difference between procedural and object-oriented programming.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the difference between procedural programming (_SunBlooming.java) and object-oriented programming (SunBlooming_.java & Item.java) using a flower shop system.

### Before OOP
- Procedural version using functions and static variables.
- Handles customer orders, invoice generation, and store owner menu.

### After OOP
- Object-Oriented version using classes:
  - Item.java: defines flower items with setters, getters, and stock management.
  - SunBlooming_.java: main program using Item objects, handles customer and owner menus.
  
### Flowers Included
- Lavender
- Sunflower
- Tulip
- Rose
- Lily

### How to Run
1. Compile Item.java and SunBlooming_.java.
2. Run SunBlooming_ for the OOP version.
3. Run _SunBlooming.java for the procedural version.
